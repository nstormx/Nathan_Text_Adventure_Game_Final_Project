Nathan's Text Adventure Game (Python)

Nathan Christensen-Padilla

For my final project I am making a text based adventure game. The main idea of the game is that you first choose your name and pick your class from a list. After that you start off at the entrance of a dungeon and have to make your way through the different rooms looting them or defeating the monsters that dwell inside.  Depending on the paths you take it may end the adventure early and if you get to the end of the dungeon then that also ends the adventure.  


All of the things I wanted in the game have been completed plus more extra things I thought about while making it.

If I had more time and knowlegde I would've liked to add some pictures or even asci art to make the dungeon feel real.
